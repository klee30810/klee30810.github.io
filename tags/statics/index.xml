      <description>Objectives
 To show how to use the method of sections to determine the internal loadings in a member
 To generalize this procedure by formulating equations that can be plotted so that they describe the internal shear and moement throughout a member

  7.1 Internal Forces Developed in Structural Members 
 normal force : $N_B$, acts perpendicular to the cross section shear force : $V_B$, acts tangential to the cross section bending moment : $M_B$ The force components prevent the relative translation between the two segments, and the couple moment prevents the relative rotation.</description>
